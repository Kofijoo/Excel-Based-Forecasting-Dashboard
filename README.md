# Excel-Based Forecasting Dashboard

A dynamic and scalable Excel tool designed to optimize software license allocation and forecast spend across multiple business units. This project empowers teams to make data-driven decisions by visualizing allocation plans, usage efficiency, and cost forecasts in real time.

## Project Overview

Organizations often face challenges in managing and forecasting software licensing costs, especially across departments with different usage patterns. This Excel-based dashboard solves that by integrating allocation data, usage insights, and cost metrics into an interactive and transparent forecasting system.

  Analyze license allocation and forecasted costs by business unit and license type.

- **Scenario Customization**  
  Simulate allocation plans using filters like month, BU, and license limits.

- **Built-in Cost Analytics**  
  Forecast cost per license and per active user using real usage percentages.

- **Utilization Flags**  
  Auto-detect underutilized licenses via conditional formatting logic.

- **Buffer Analysis**  
  Track over- or under-provisioned plans using buffer thresholds.

- **Dynamic Dashboard**  
  Visual summary using stacked columns, line charts, bar charts, and donut charts.
